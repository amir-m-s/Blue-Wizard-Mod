Work on utilizing 22 GPIO pins with BlueMicro firmware is progressing, albeit slowly.
 
If you have experience with the BlueMicro firmware (https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_BLE) and pcb design, and are willing to lend a hand, reach out to me and I can send you one of the assembled boards for you to work with. I'm open to having discussions about contracted contributions as well.
